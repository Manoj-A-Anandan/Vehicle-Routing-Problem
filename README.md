# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with Genetic Algorithms

This repository implements a solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Genetic Algorithms (GA). The problem involves optimizing the routes of multiple vehicles to visit a set of locations while minimizing total travel distance and balancing the workload across vehicles.

## Features
- **Random Location Generation**: Generate random coordinates for locations and a central depot.
- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: Use the DEAP library to configure and execute the GA.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Minimize total travel distance and balance vehicle workloads.
- **Visualization**: Display optimized routes using Matplotlib with unique colors for each vehicle.
